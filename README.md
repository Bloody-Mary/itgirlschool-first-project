First school project.

First project: Online store.

Project goals: to develop the principles of OOP, data input/output streams, data structures and Stream API.

Worked as a team using Agile. Learned how to work with Git in one branch.

An analogue of a database was used for this project (not yet a real database). CRUD operations were used in the code.
